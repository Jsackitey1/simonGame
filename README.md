### Simon Game

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic "Simon" memory game. The game challenges players to remember and replicate increasingly complex sequences of colors and sounds.

#### Features:
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Users interact with four color buttons, each producing a unique sound when clicked.
- **Dynamic Level Progression**: The game automatically increases the level difficulty as players successfully replicate sequences.
- **Game Over Feedback**: A visual and audio indication is provided when the player makes a mistake, and the game can be restarted with a key press.

#### Technologies Used:
- **HTML5**: Structure of the game interface.
- **CSS3**: Styling and animations, including a retro aesthetic with pixel fonts.
- **JavaScript/jQuery**: Game logic, user interaction handling, and dynamic DOM manipulation.

#### How to Play:
1. Press any key to start the game.
2. Watch the sequence of lights and sounds.
3. Click the buttons in the same sequence.
4. The sequence gets longer with each correct answer.
5. If you make a mistake, the game will give you feedback, and you can start over.
